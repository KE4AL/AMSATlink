# AMSATlink
A CubeSat Constellation that Enables Cross-Link Communication and Multipoint Scientific Measurements


AMSATlink is a proposed formation of nanosatellites linked in a peer-to-peer communications network, dynamically configured to allow for the addition and subtraction of new spacecraft and ground stations.  In addition, AMSATlink will allow for multi-point collection of space weather measurements to contribute a unique set of scientific data for scientific and educational analysis.

## Features:

- Individual satellite and ground nodes connect directly, dynamically, and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to create one virtual network that can efficiently route data from/to clients.

- If one endpoint cannot see its desired destination, but can see nodes in between, the data will hop from one to the next until the final connection is made â€“ completely and automatically.

- Small stack protocol to reduce overhead and ease communications between network nodes

- Absolute timing obtained from GPS

- IEEE 802.11 wireless ad hoc network, operating within the FCC Part 97 amateur radio frequency allocation of the 2.4 GHz microwave band
